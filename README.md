# Standard Point Positioning with Rinex Observation & Navigation Files

## Overview
This project is a Python-based application designed for post-processed **Standard Point Positioning (SPP)** and **Precise Point Positioning (PPP)**. The goal is to evaluate the accuracy of widely used GNSS post-processing tools such as **RTKLib, AUSPOS, and PRIDE-PPAR**.

## Features
- **SPP and PPP Post-Processing**: Implements algorithms for GNSS-based positioning.
- **Accuracy Evaluation**: Compares results with established GNSS computation tools.
- **Open-Source & Extendable**: The code is modular and open for further development.

## Current Progress
- âœ… Completed SPP implementation and accuracy assessment.
- ðŸš€ Working on **PPK (Post-Processed Kinematic Positioning)** for precise moving receiver positioning.

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yagizalbayrak/spp.git

```

## Data Sources
- **GNSS Observation Data**: RINEX format
- **Precise Ephemeris & Clock Data**: Download from IGS/NASA repositories

## Future Work
- Implementing PPK for kinematic positioning
- Enhancing visualization and reporting
